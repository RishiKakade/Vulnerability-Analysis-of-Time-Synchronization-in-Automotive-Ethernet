This GitHub repository contains the source code and materials for the paper titled [Analysis of Failure Modes in IEEE 802.3bw Time Synchronization Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11878). The paper investigates the failure modes that affect the ability of in-vehicle automotive Ethernet networks to synchronize clocks between electronic control units (ECUs). 

The paper presents an analysis of the time synchronization protocol used in IEEE 802.3bw, which is becoming the most popular in-vehicle communication protocol between ECUs. We demonstrate the normal operation, failover to the hot-standby clock, and a black hole attack on one network switch using the OMNet++ discrete event simulator.
